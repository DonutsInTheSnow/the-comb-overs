# Tinnitus Tees - Next.js Portfolio Project

Now, **The Comb Overs** ain’t nothin’ but a fancy e-commerce contraption, spun up with this newfangled [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to show I can wrangle a full-stack web doodad from start to finish. It’s the second of ten such ventures I reckon to undertake, each one a different critter with its own peculiar ways and means. You’ll find a catalog of goods, a cart to toss ‘em in, and a Stripe checkout that’ll take your money quicker’n a Mississippi gambler, all tied up neat with Supabase to keep the orders straight.

## Purpose

This here mock-up’s meant to prove to prospective bosses and tinkerers alike that I can build, test, and set sail a Next.js app without runnin’ aground. I’ve thrown in some Jest testin’ to keep things honest and shipped it off to Vercel for the world to see—provided they ain’t too busy fishin’ for compliments elsewhere.

## Live Demo

Visit the production app at [https://the-comb-overs.vercel.app/](https://the-comb-overs.vercel.app/) to see it in action.

## Getting Started Locally

To run the app locally, clone the repo, install dependencies, and set up environment variables (see `.env.local` requirements). Then, run the development server:

```
bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Deployment

Deployed on Vercel. See [Next.js deployment docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/deploying) for details.
